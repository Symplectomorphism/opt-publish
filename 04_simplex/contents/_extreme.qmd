# Adjacent Basic Feasible Solutions (Extreme Points)

## Adjacent Solutions {.smaller}

* We know that it is only necessary to consider basic feasible solutions to the
system
$$ \bm{Ax} = \bm{b}, \quad \bm{x} \geq \bm{0} $$ {#eq-pc}
when solving a linear program.

* The idea of the simplex method is to move from a basic feasible solution
(extreme point) to an adjacent one with an improved objective value.

## Definition
Two basic feasible solutions are said to be _adjacent_ if and only if they
differ by one basic variable.
:::

* A new basic solution can be generated from an old one by replacing one current
basic variable by a current nonbasic one.
  - It is _impossible_ to arbitrarily specify a pair of variables whose roles
    are to be interchanged and expect to maintain the nonnegativity condition.
  - However, it is __possible__ to arbitrarily specify which current nonbasic
    (entering or incoming) variable is to become basic and then determine which
    current basic (leaving or outgoing) variable should become nonbasic.

* Let the BFS be partitioned as $\bm{x}_{\bm{B}} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m)$ and

* $\bm{b}$ is a linear combination of columns of $\bm{B} =
\begin{bmatrix} \bm{a}_1 & \bm{a}_2 & \cdots & \bm{a}_m \end{bmatrix}$ with the
positive multipliers $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m)$.

$$ \bm{b} = \bm{B}\bm{x}_{\bm{B}} = x_1\bm{a}_1 + x_2 \bm{a}_2 + \cdots +

* Suppose we decided to bring into representation the $e^{\text{th}}$ (entering)
column vector of $\bm{A}$, $\bm{a}_e$ ($e > m$), while keeping all others
nonbasic.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
* A new representation of $\bm{b}$ as a linear combination of $m+1$ vectors
($\bm{a}_e$ added to the current basis $\bm{B}$) for any nonnegative multiplier
$x_e$ and $\bm{x}_{\bm{B}}$:
:::

$$ \bm{b} = \bm{Bx_B} + \bm{a}_ex_e, \quad \text{or} \quad \bar{\bm{a}}_0 =
\bm{B}^{-1}\bm{b} = \bm{x}_{\bm{B}} + (\bm{B}^{-1}\bm{a}_e)x_e. $$ {#eq-plc2}

* Since $x_e$ is the incoming variable, its value needs to be increased from the
current $0$ to a positive value, say $\varepsilon \geq 0$.

* As $x_e$ value increases, the current basic variable $\bm{x}_{\bm{B}}$ needs
to be adjusted accordingly ot keep the feasibility.

## Determination of a Vector to Leave the Basis {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
* For $\varepsilon = 0$, we have the old basic feasible solution
$\bm{x}_{\bm{B}} = \bar{\bm{a}}_0 > \bm{0}$.
* The values of $\bm{x}_{\bm{B}}$ will either increase or remain unchanged if
$\bar{a}_{ie} \leq 0$; or decrease linearly as $\varepsilon$ is increased if
$\bar{a}_{ie} > 0$.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
* For small enough $\varepsilon$, @eq-plc2 gives a feasible but nonbasic
solution.
* If any decrease, we may set $\varepsilon$ equal to the value corresponding to
the first place where one (or more) of the value vanishes
:::

::::

$$ \varepsilon = \operatorname{min}_i \left\{\frac{\bar{a}_{i0}}{\bar{a}_{ie}}:
\bar{a}_{ie} > 0 \right\}. $$ {#eq-eps}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
* We have a new BFS, with the vector $\bm{a}_e$ replacing (outgoing) column
$\bm{a}_o$, where index $o \leq m$ correspondes to the minimizing-ratio in
@eq-eps
$$ o = \operatorname{arg \, min}_i \left\{\frac{\bar{a}_{i0}}{\bar{a}_{ie}}:
\bar{a}_{ie} > 0 \right\}.$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
* If none of the $\bar{a}_{ie}$'s are positive, then all coefficients in
@eq-plc2 increase (or remain constant) as $\varepsilon$ is increased, and no new
basic feasible solution is obtained.

* In this case the set $K$ of feasible solutions to @eq-pc is unbounded.

## Conic Combination Interpretations {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
* The basis transformation can be represented in the _requirements space_, the
space where columns of $\bm{A}$ and $\bm{b}$ are represented.

$$ \bm{a}_1x_1 + \bm{a}_2x_2 + \cdots + \bm{a}_nx_n = \bm{b}. $$

* A feasible solution defines a representation of $\bm{b}$ as a conic
combination of the $\bm{a}_i$'s.
* A BFS will only use $m$ psoitive weights.
* Suppose we start with $\bm{a}_1$ and $\bm{a}_2$ as the initial basis.
  - Then an adjacent basis is found by bringing in some other vector.
  - If $\bm{a}_3$ is brought in, then clearly $\bm{a}_2$ must go out (why?).
  - On the other hand, if $\bm{a}_4$ is brought in, $\bm{a}_1$ must go out
    (why?).

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
* A BFS can be constructed with positive weights on $\bm{a}_1$ and $\bm{a}_2$
because $\bm{b}$ lies between them.
* A BFS cannot be constructed with positive weights on $\bm{a}_1$ and
$\bm{a}_4$.
:::

:::

::::

* Another interpretation is in the _activity space_, the space where $\bm{x}$
lives.
  - Here, the feasible region is shown directly as a convex set, and BFS are
    extreme points.
  - Adjacent extreme points are points that lie on a common edge.

$$

* <span style="font-size:95%">From @eq-eps, $\varepsilon = 2$ and $\bm{a}_2$ is the outgoing column so that
the new basis is formed by $\bm{a}_1$ and $\bm{a}_3$. </span>

* Now, suppose we start with $\bm{a}_1$ and $\bm{a}_3$ as the initial basis and
select $\bm{a}_4$ as the incoming column. Then

$$
\begin{equation}
\bm{B} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ -2 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \bm{B}^{-1} =

2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \bar{\bm{a}}_4 =
\bm{B}^{-1}\bm{a}_4 = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -2
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
$$

* Since the entries of the incoming column $\bar{\bm{a}}_4$ are all negative,
$\varepsilon$ in @eq-eps can go to $\infty$, indicating that the feasible region
is unbounded.
