# Global Convergence of Descent Algorithms

## Algorithms

* __Iterative__: the algorithm generates a series of points, each point being
calculated on the basis of the points preceding it.
* __Descent__: as each new point is generated by the algorithm the corresponding
value of some function decreases in value.

* An iterative algorithm is initiated by specifying a starting point.
  - If for arbitrary starting points, the algorithm is guaranteed to generate a
    sequence of points converging to a solution, then the algorithm is said to
    be _globally convergent_.
  - Not all algorithms have this desirable property: indeed, many of the most
    important algorithms for NLP are not globally convergent.
  - They occasionally generate sequences that do not converge at all or converge
    to points that are not solutions.


## Iterative Algorithms {.smaller}

* We formally define an algorithm $\bm{A}$ as a mapping, $\;\; \bm{A}: X
\rightarrow X$. Operated iteratively, the algorithm $\bm{A}$ initiated at
$\bm{x}_0 \in X$ would generates a sequence $\{\bm{x}_k\}$ defined by

$$ \bm{x}_{k+1} = \bm{A}(\bm{x}_k). $$

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Definition (Algorithm &ndash; a generalization)
An _algorithm_ $\bm{A}$ is a mapping defined on a space $X$ that assigns to
every point $\bm{x} \in X$ a subset of $X$. That is, the mapping $\bm{A}$ is a
_point-to-set_ mapping of $X$.
:::

* An algorithm $\bm{A}$, therefore, generates a sequence of points in the
following way.
  - Given $\bm{x}_k \in X$, the algorithm yields $\bm{A}(\bm{x}_k) \subseteq X$.
  - From this subset an arbitrary element $\bm{x}_{k+1}$ is selected.
  - In this way, given an initial point $\bm{x}_0$, the algorithm generates
    sequences through the iteration


$$ \bm{x}_{k+1} \in \bm{A}(\bm{x}_k). $$

* The utility of this more general definition is that it allows one to analyze
the convergence of an infinite family of similar algorithms.

## Example
Suppose for $x \in \mathbb{R}$, we define 

$$ A(x) = \left[ -\frac{|x|}{2}, \frac{|x|}{2} \right ] $$

so that $A(x)$ is an interval of the real line.

* Let us start at $x_0 = 100$.
* Each of the following sequences below might be generated from an iterative
application of this algorithm.

 $$ \left\{100, 50, 25, 12, -6, -2, 1, \frac{1}{2}, \ldots \right\} $$
 $$ \left\{100, -40, 20, -5, -2, 1, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \ldots \right\} $$
 $$ \left\{100, 10, -1, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{100}, -\frac{1}{1000}, \frac{1}{10000}, \ldots \right\} $$

## Descent {.smaller}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Definition (Descent)
Let $\Gamma \subseteq X$ be a given solution set and let $\bm{A}$ be an
algorithm on $X$. A continuous real-valued function $Z$ on $X$ is said to be a
_descent function_ for $\Gamma$ and $\bm{A}$ if it satisfies

1. if $\bm{x} \notin \Gamma$ and $\bm{y} \in \bm{A}(\bm{x})$, then $Z(\bm{y}) <
Z(\bm{x})$,
2. if $\bm{x} \in \Gamma$ and $\bm{y} \in \bm{A}(\bm{x})$, then $Z(\bm{y}) \leq
Z(\bm{x})$.
:::

* There are a number of ways a solution set, algorithm, and descent function can
be defined. 

* A natural set-up for the problem 

$$
\begin{align}
\operatorname{minimize} & f(\bm{x}) \\
\text{subject to} & \bm{x} \in \Omega
\end{align}
$$

* $\Gamma$ be the set of minimizing points; define an algorithm $\bm{A}$ on
$\Omega$ in such a way that $f$ decreases at each step (descent function).

* Another possibility: $\Gamma$ is the set of points $\bm{x}$ satisfying $\nabla
f(\bm{x}) = 0$. $|\nabla f(\bm{x})|$ might then serve as a descent function.


## Global Convergence Theorem {.smaller}

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The set-up

* There is a solution set $\Gamma$
* Points are generated according to $\bm{x}_{k+1} \in \bm{A}(\bm{x}_k)$
* Each new point strictly decreases a descent function $\bm{Z}$ unless the
solution set $\Gamma$ is reached.

## Global Convergence Theorem
Let $\bm{A}$ be an algorithm on $X$, and suppose that, given $\bm{x}_0$, the
sequence $\left\{\bm{x}_k\right\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is generated satisfying 

$$ \bm{x}_{k+1} \in \bm{A}(\bm{x}_k). $$

Let a solution set $\Gamma \subseteq X$ be given, and suppose

1. all points $\bm{x}_k$ are contained in a compact set $S \subseteq X$,
2. there is a continuous function $\bm{Z}$ on $X$ such that
    a. if $\bm{x} \notin \Gamma$ and $\bm{y} \in \bm{A}(\bm{x})$, then $Z(\bm{y}) < Z(\bm{x})$,
    b. if $\bm{x} \in \Gamma$ and $\bm{y} \in \bm{A}(\bm{x})$, then $Z(\bm{y}) \leq Z(\bm{x})$.
3. the mapping $\bm{A}$ is closed at points outside $\Gamma$.

Then the limit of any convergent subsequence of $\{\bm{x}_k\}$ is a solution.

## Example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
Consider the point-to-set algorithm $\bm{A}$ defined by the graph in the figure
on the right.

This is given explicitly on $X = [0, 1]$ by 

$$ 
\bm{A}(x) = 
\begin{cases}
  [0, x)  & n 0 < x \leq 1 \\
  0 & x = 0,
\end{cases}
$$

Letting $\Gamma = \{0\}$, the function $Z(x) = x$ serves as a descent function
because for $x \neq 0$ all points in $\bm{A}(x)$ are less than $x$.
