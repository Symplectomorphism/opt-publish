# Policies and Value Functions

## How good are a state and an action? {.smaller}

* The rewards the agent can expect to receive in the future depend on what
actions it will take.
* Value functions are defined with respect to paricular ways of acting, called
_policies_.

## Definition
A _policy_ is a mapping from states o probabilities of selecting each possible
action.

* If the agent is following policy $\pi$ at time $t$, then $\pi(a|s)$ is
the probability that $A_t = a$ given that $S_t = s$.
* $\pi(a|s)$ defines a probability distribution over $a \in \mathcal{A}(s)$ for
each $s \in \mathcal{S}$.

## Definition (State-Value Function for Policy $\pi$)
The _value function_ of a state $s$ under a policy $\pi$, denoted $v_\pi(s)$, is
the expected return when starting in $s$ and following $\pi$ thereafter.

$$ 
\begin{align}
v_\pi(s) &\triangleq \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | S_t = s] \\ 
&= \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} | S_t = s \right],
\;\; \forall s \in \mathcal{S}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-val-fcn}

* The value of the terminal state, if any, is always zero.

## Definition (Action-Value Function for Policy $\pi$)
We define the value of taking action $a$ in state $s$ under a policy $\pi$,
denoted $q_\pi(s, a)$, as the expected return starting from $s$, taking the
action $a$, and thereafter following policy $\pi$:

$$ 
\begin{align}
q_\pi(s, a) &\triangleq \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | S_t=s, A_t=a] \\
&= \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left. \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\right| S_t=s, 
A_t=a \right].
\end{align}

## Fundamental property of Value Functions
Value functions saisfy recursive relationships similar that which we established
for the return @eq-ret-rec.

For any policy $\pi$ and any state $s$, the following consistency condition
holds between he value of $s$ and he value of its possible successor states:

$$
\begin{align}
v_\pi(s) \triangleq &= \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t|S_t=s] = \mathbb{E}_\pi[R_{t+1} +
\gamma G_{t+1}|S_t = s], \quad {\text{by (9)} }\\
&= \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(a|s)\sum_{s',r}p(s',r|s,a)\left[r + \gamma
\mathbb{E}_\pi[G_{t+1}|S_{t+1}=s']\right] \\
&= \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s', r}p(s',r|s,a)\left[r + \gamma
v_\pi(s')\right],
\quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}.
\end{align}

* Each open circle represents a state and each solid circle represents a
state-action pair.

some set of actions &mdash; three are shown &mdash; based on its policy $\pi$.

* From each of these, the environment could respond with one of several next
states, $s'$ (two are shown), along with a reward, $r$, depending on its
dynamics, given by the function $p$.
* Bellman equation averages over all the possibilites, weighing each by its
probability of occuring: the value of the start state must equal the
(discounted) value of the expected next state, plus the reward expected along
the way.

## Example &mdash; Gridworld {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.fragment .fade-out fragment-index=1}
* Gridworld is a finite Markov Decision Process.
  - The cells of the grid correspond to the states.
  - At each cell, four actions are possible: $\texttt{north}$, $\texttt{south}$,
    $\texttt{east}$, $\texttt{west}$
  - These actions _deterministically_ cause the agent to move one cell in the
    respective direction of the grid.
* Actions that would take the agent off the grid leave its location unchanged,
but also incur a reward of $-1$.
* Other actions reward $0$, except those that move the agent out of the special
states $A$ and $B$.
  - From state $A$, all four actions yield a reward of $+10$ and take the agent
    to $A'$.
  - From state $B$, all actions yield a reward of $+5$ and take the agent to
    $B'$.

## Exercise
The Bellman @eq-bellman must hold for each state for the value function $v_\pi$.
Show numerically that this equation holds for the center state, valued at
$+0.7$, w.r.t. its four neighboring states, valued at $+2.3$, $+0.4$, $-0.4$,
and $+0.7$ (accurate to one decimal place).

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
* The agent selects all four actions with equal probability in all states.
* Figure at the bottom shows the value function, $v_\pi$, for this policy, for
the discounted reward case with $\gamma = \frac{9}{10}$.
* Notice the negative values near the lower edge.
  - these are the results of the high probability of hitting the edge of the
    grid under the random policy.
* State $A$ is the best state to be in under this policy.
  - Note: $A$'s expected return is _less_ than its immediate reward of $10$
    because from $A$ the agent is taken to state $A'$ from which it is likely to
    run into the edge of the grid.
* State $B$, on the other hand, is valued _more_ than its immediate reward of
$5$, because from $B$ the agent is taken to $B'$ which has a positive value.
  - From $B'$ the expected penalty (negative reward) for possibly running into
    an edge is more than compensated for by the expected gain for possibly
    stumbling onto $A$ or $B$.

## <span style="font-size:99%"> Optimal Policies and Optimal Value Functions </span> {.smaller}

* We want to find a policy that achieves a lot of reward over the long run.
* Value functions define a partial ordering over policies: a policy $\pi$ is
defined to be better than or equal to a policy $\pi'$ if its expected return is
greater than or equal to that of $\pi'$ for all states.
  $$ \pi \geq \pi' \Longleftrightarrow v_{\pi}(s) \geq v_{\pi'}(s), \quad
  \forall s \in \mathcal{S}. $$
* $\exists$ always at least one policy that is better than or equal to all other
policies: an _optimal policy_.
  - Although there may be more than one, let us denot all the optimal policies
    by $\pi_\ast$.
  - They share the same state-value function, called the _optimal state-value
    function_: 

    $$ v_\ast(s) \triangleq \operatorname{max}_\pi v_{\pi}(s), \quad
    \forall s \in \mathcal{S}. $$ {#eq-optimal-st-val}
* Optimal policies also share the same _optimal action-value function_:

    $$ q_\ast(s, a) \triangleq \operatorname{max}_\pi q_{\pi}(s, a), \quad
    \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, \; a \in \mathcal{A}(s). $$ {#eq-optimal-act-val}

* For the state-action pair $(s,a)$, this function gives the expected return for
taking action $a$ in state $s$ and thereafter following an optimal policy.
  - Thus, we can write $q_\ast$ in terms of $v_\ast$ as follows:
$$ q_\ast (s, a) = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_\ast(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s, A_t =
a]. $$ {#eq-q-w-v}


## Bellman Optimality Equation {.smaller}

* Because $v_\ast$ is the value function for a policy, it must satisfy the
self-consistency condition given by the Bellman equation for state values @eq-bellman.
* But it is also the optimal value function so $v_\ast$'s consistency condition
can be written in a special form w/o reference to any specific policy!

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
The Bellman optimality equation expresses the fact that the value of a state
under an optimal policy must equal the expected return for the best action from
that state.

$$
\begin{align}
v_\ast(s) &= \operatorname{max}_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} q_{\pi_\ast}(s, a) =
\operatorname{max}_{a} \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\ast}[G_t | S_t =s, A_t = a] \\
&= \operatorname{max}_a \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\ast}[R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1} | S_t =
s, A_t = a] \\
&= \operatorname{max}_a \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\ast}[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_\ast(S_{t+1}) | S_t =
s, A_t = a] \\
&= \operatorname{max}_a \sum_{s', r} p(s', r|s, a)[r + \gamma v_\ast(s')].
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-bellman-optimality-v}

* The Bellman optimality equation for $q_\ast$ is

$$
q_\ast(s, a) = \mathbb{E}\left[R_{t+1} + \gamma \operatorname{max}_{a'}
q_\ast(S_{t+1}, a) \mid S_t = s, A_t = a\right] = \sum_{s', r} p(s', r|s, a) 
\left[ r+ \gamma \operatorname{max}_{a'} q_\ast (s', a') \right].
