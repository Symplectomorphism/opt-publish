# Markov Decision Processes (MDP)

## Introduction

* MDPs are a classical formalization of sequential decision making.
  - Actions influence not just immediate rewards, but also subsequent states,
    and through those, future rewards.
  - They are meant to be a straightforward framing of the problem of learning
    from interaction to achieve a goal.
* MDPs involve delayed reward and the need to trade off immediate and delayed 
reward.
* We will estimate the value $q_\ast(s, a)$ of each action $a$ in each state
$s$,
  - or we estimate the value $v_\ast(s)$ of each state given optimal action
    selections.
* These state-dependent quantities are essential to accurately assigning credit
for long-term consequences to individual action selections.

* The decision maker is called the _agent_ or _controller_.
* The thing it interacts with, everything outside the agent, is called the
_environment_ or _plant_.
* These interact continually, the agent selecting _actions_ (or _control
 signal_) and the environment responding to these control signals and presenting
 new situations to the agent.
* The environment also gives rise to _rewards_, special numerical values that the
agent seeks to maximize over time through its choice of actions.
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
* The agent and environment interact at each of a sequence of discrete time
steps, $t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$. 
  - At each time step $t$, the agent receives some respresentation of the
    environment's _state_, $S_t \in \mathcal{S}$, and on that basis selects an
    action $A_t \in \mathcal{A}(s)$.
  - One time step later, in part as a consequence of its actions, the agent
    receives a numerical reward, $R_{t+1} \in \mathcal{R} \in \mathbb{R}$ and
    finds itself in a new state, $S_{t+1}$.
* The MDP and agent together give rise to a trajectory that begins like this:
$$ S_0, A_0, S_1, R_1, A_2, R_2, S_2, A_2, R_3, \ldots $$ {#eq-traj}

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
* In a _finite_ MDP, the sets of states, actions, and rewards   
$(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R})$ all have a finite number of elements.
  - In this case, the random variables $R_t$ and $S_t$ have
    well defined discrete probability distributions dependent on the preceding
    state and action.

$$ p(s', r \mid s, a) \triangleq \mathbb{P}\{S_t = s', R_t = r \mid S_{t-1} = s,
A_{t-1} = a\} $$ {#eq-dyn}

* This function $p$ defines the _dynamics_ of the MDP.
  - It specifies a probability distribution for each choice of $s$ and $a$,
    i.e.,

$$ \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} p(s', r \mid s, a) = 1,
\quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, \; a \in \mathcal{A}(s). $$ {#eq-pprob}

* This is called the _Markov property_.

## The Agent &ndash; Environment Interface {.smaller}

* From the four-argument dynamics function, $p$, one can compute anything else
one might want to know about the environment
  - the _state-transition probabilities_
$$ p(s' \mid s, a) \triangleq \mathbb{P}\{S_t = s' \mid S_{t-1} = a, A_{t-1} =
a\} = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} p(s', r \mid s, a). $$ {#eq-st-trans}
  - the expected rewards for state-action pairs as a two-argument function 
  $$ r(s, a) \triangleq \mathbb{E}[R_t \mid S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a] = \sum_{r
  \in \mathcal{R}} r \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s', r \mid s, a), $$ {#eq-exp-rew-sa}
  - the expected rewards for state-action-next-state triples as a three argument
    function 
  $$ r(s, a, s') \triangleq \mathbb{E}[R_t \mid S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a, S_t =
  s'] = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} r \; \frac{p(s', r \mid s, a)}{p(s' \mid s, a)}.
  $$ {#eq-exp-rew-sas}

* The time steps can refer to arbitrary successive stages of decision making.
* The actions can be low-level controls (e.g. voltages), or high-level decisions
(e.g. have lunch, go to grad school).
* They can be determined by low-level sensing (e.g. sensor readings) or they can
be more high-level and abstract (e.g. symbolic descriptions of objects in a
room).
* States can be anything we can know that might be useful in making the
decisions.

## Rule of thumb
* Anything that cannot be changed arbitrarily by the agent is considered to be
outside of it and thus part of its environment.
:::

* Not everything in the environment is unknown to the agent.
  - For example, the agent often knows how its rewards are computed as a
    function of its actions and the states.
  - Reward computation is external to the agent because it defines the task
    facing the agent and thus is beyond its ability to change arbitrarily.
* In fact, some agents know _everything_ about how its environment.

## MDP framework
Whatever the details of the sensory, memory, and control apparatus, and whatever
objective one is trying to achieve, any problem of learning goal-directed
behavior can be reduced to three signals passing back and forth between an agent
and its environment:

1. one signal to represent the choices made by the agent (the actions),
2. one signal to represent the basis on which the choices are made (the states),
3. one signal to define the agent's goal (the rewards).

## Examples {.smaller}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Example 1 &ndash; Bioreactor
Suppose we want to determine moment-by-moment temperatures and stirring rates
for a bioreactor.

* The actions might be target temperatures and target stirring rates that are
passed to the lower-level control system,
  - The control system, in turn, will activate heating elements and motors to
  attain the targets.
* The states could be the outputs of a thermocouple and other sensory readings
* The rewards might be moment-by-moment measures of the rate at which the useful
chemical is being produced by the bioreactor.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Example 2 &ndash; Pick-and-Place Robot
Suppose we want to control the motion of a robot arm in a repetitive
pick-and-place task.

* The actions might be the voltages applied to each motor at each joint.
* The states might be the latest readings of joint angles and velocities.
* The reward might be $+1$ for each object successfully picked up and placed.
  - To encourage smooth movements, at each time step, a small, negative reward
  could be given as a function of the moment-to-moment jerkiness of the motion.

## Homework
Devise three example tasks of your own that fit into the MDP framework,
identifying for each states, actions, and rewards.

## Example &mdash; Recycling Robot {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.fragment .fade-out fragment-index=1}
* A mobile robot has the job of collecting empty soda cans in an office
environment.
* It has sensors for detecting cans, and an arm and gripper that can pick them
up and place them in an onboard bin; it runs on a rechargable battery.
* The robot's control system has components for
  - interpreting sensory information,
  - for navigating,
  - and for controlling the arm and gripper.
* High-level decisions about how to search for cans are to be made by the agent
on the current charge level of the battery.
  - $\mathcal{S} = \{\texttt{high}, \texttt{low}\}$.
  - $\mathcal{A}(\texttt{high}) = \{\texttt{search}, \texttt{wait}\}$, 
    $\mathcal{A}(\texttt{low}) = \{\texttt{search}, \texttt{wait}, \texttt{recharge}\}$.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out fragment-index=2}
* The rewards are zero most of the time, but become positive when the robot
secures an empty can, or large and negative if the battery runs all the down.
* Best way to find cans is to actively search for them, but this runs down the
robot's battery.
  - If the battery is depleted, the robot must be rescued (producing a low
    reward).
* If the energy is $\texttt{high}$ then a period active search can always be
completed w/o risk of depleting the battery.
* A period of searching that begins with a $\texttt{high}$ energy level leaves
the energy level $\texttt{high}$ with probability $\alpha$ and reduces it to
$\texttt{low}$ with probability $1-\alpha$.
* A period of searching undertaken when the energy level is $\texttt{low}$
leaves it $\texttt{low}$ with probability $\beta$ and depletes the battery with
probability $1-\beta$.
  - Robot must be rescued and the battery is then recharged back to
    $\texttt{high}$.
:::


::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
* Each can collected by the robot counts as a unit reward, whereas a reward of
$-3$ results whenever the robot has to be rescued.
* Let $r_{\text{search}}$ and $r_{\text{wait}}$ with $r_{\text{search}} >
r_{\text{wait}}$ denote the expected number of cans the robot will collect.
* Finally, suppose that no cans can be collected during a run home for
recharging, and that no cans can be collected on a step in which the battery is
depleted.

## Exercise
Give a table analogous to the one on the right but for $p(s', r | s, a)$. It
should have columns for $s, a, s', r$ and $p(s', r|s,a)$ and a row every
$4$-tuple for which $p(s', r| s, a) > 0$.

## Goals and Rewards {.smaller}

* The agent's goal is to _maximize_ the total amount of reward it receives;
_not_ the immediate reward, but the cumulative reward in the long run.

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Reward Hypothesis
All of what we mean by goal and purposes can be well thought as the maximization
of the expected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (called
reward).
:::

* Formulating goals in terms of reward signals has proved to be flexible and
widely applicable.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Examples
| Task | Reward |
|------|--------|
|Robot walking|$+$ve reward on each time step proportional to robot's forward motion|
|Escape from a maze| $-1$ reward for every time step that passes prior to escape|
|Playing chess|$+1$ for winning, $-1$ for losing, $0$ for drawing|
:::

* The reward signal is no the place to impart to the agent prior knowledge
about _how_ to achieve what we want it to do (better places: initial policy,
iniial value function).
  - Otherwise the agent might find a way to achieve _subgoals_ without achieving
    the real goal!


## Returns and Episodes {.smaller}

* In general, we seek to maximize the _expected return_, where the return,
denoted $G_t$, is defined as some specific function of the reward sequence.
  - Simplest (bit na&iuml;ve) case: $$ G_t \triangleq R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + \cdots + R_T = \sum_{k=t+1}^T R_k,  $$ {#eq-rew-episode}
  - _Discounted return_: $$ G_t \triangleq \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^kR_{t+k+1} =
  \sum_{k=t+1}^T \gamma^{k-t-1}R_k, \quad 0 \leq \gamma \leq 1. $$ {#eq-rew-discounted}
* The na&iuml;ve approach makes sense in applications in which there is a
natural notion of a final time step (_episodes_).
  - Each episodes ends in a state called the _terminal state_.
  - In _episodic tasks_ we sometimes need to distinguish the set of all
  nonterminal states, $\mathcal{S}$ from the set of all states plus the terminal
  state, $\mathcal{S}^+$.
* If the task has no final time, or terminal state, then $T=\infty$. 
  - The na&iuml;ve return may easily become infinite. Hence we use the discounted return.
$$ G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma(R_{t+2} + \gamma R_{t+3} + \gamma^2 R_{t+4} + \cdots)
= R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1}. $$ {#eq-ret-rec}


## Example &mdash; Pole-Balancing {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
* A failure is said to occur if the pole falls past a given angle from vertical
or if the cart runs off the track.
  - The pole is reset to vertical after each failure.
* This task could be treated as _episodic_, where the natural episodes are the
repeated atempts to balance the pole.
  - The reward in this case would be $+1$ for every time step on which failure
    did not occur.
  - The return at each time would be the number of steps until failure.
  - Successful balancing forever would mean a return of infinity.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Objective: Apply forces to a cart moving along a track so as to keep a pole
hinged to the cart from falling over.
:::
:::

::::

* Alternatively, we could treat pole-balancing as a continuing task, using
discounting.
  - In his case the reward would be $-1$ on each failur and zero all other
    times.
  - The return at each time would the be related to $-\gamma^{K-1}$, where $K$
    is the number of time steps before failure.
* In either case, the return is maximized by keeping the pole balanced for as
long as possible.
