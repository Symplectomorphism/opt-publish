    "text": "Introduction\n\nMDPs are a classical formalization of sequential decision making.\n\nActions influence not just immediate rewards, but also subsequent states, and through those, future rewards.\nThey are meant to be a straightforward framing of the problem of learning from interaction to achieve a goal.\n\nMDPs involve delayed reward and the need to trade off immediate and delayed reward.\nWe will estimate the value q*(s,a)q_\\ast(s, a) of each action aa in each state ss,\n\nor we estimate the value v*(s)v_\\ast(s) of each state given optimal action selections.\n\nThese state-dependent quantities are essential to accurately assigning credit for long-term consequences to individual action selections."
