## Definition
A point $\bm{x}$ in a convex set $C$ is said to be an _extreme point_ of $C$ if
there are no two distinct points $\bm{x}_1$ and $\bm{x}_2$ in $C$ such that
$\bm{x} = \alpha \bm{x}_1 + (1-\alpha)\bm{x}_2$ for some $\alpha$, $0 < \alpha <
1$.

* An extreme point is thus a point that does not lie strictly within a line
segment connecting two other points of the set.

## Theorem (Equivalence of Extreme Points and Basic Solutions).
Let $\bm{A}$ be an $m \times n$ matrix of rank $m$ and $\bm{b}$ an $m$-vector.
Let $K$ be the convex polytope consisting of all $n$-vectors $\bm{x}$ satisfying 

$$ \bm{Ax} = \bm{b}, \;\; \bm{x} \geq \bm{0}. $$ {#eq-p6}

A vector $\bm{x}$ is an extreme point of $K$ if and only if $\bm{x}$ is a basic
feasible solution to @eq-p6.

## Proof
Suppose first that $\bm{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m, 0, 0, \ldots, 0)$ is a
basic feasible solution to @eq-p6. Then 

$$ x_1 \bm{a}_1 + x_2\bm{a}_2 + \cdots + x_m\bm{a}_m = \bm{b}, $$ 

where $\bm{a}_1, \bm{a}_2, \ldots, \bm{a}_m$, the first $m$ columns of $\bm{A}$
are linearly independent. Suppose that $\bm{x}$ could be expressed as a convex
combination of two other points in K; say, $\bm{x} = \alpha \bm{y} +
(1-\alpha)\bm{z}$, $0 < \alpha < 1$, $\bm{y} \neq \bm{z}$.

## Extreme Points {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Proof
Since all components of $\bm{x}$, $\bm{y}$, $\bm{z}$ are nonnegative and since
$0 < \alpha < 1$, it follows immediately that the last $n-m$ components of
$\bm{y}$ and $\bm{z}$ are zero. Thus, in particular, we have 

$$ y_1\bm{a}_1 + y_2\bm{a}_2 + \cdots + y_m\bm{a}_m = \bm{b} $$

and 

$$ z_1\bm{a}_1 + z_2\bm{a}_2 + \cdots + z_m\bm{a}_m = \bm{b}. $$

Since the vectors $\bm{a}_1, \bm{a}_2, \ldots, \bm{a}_m$ are linearly
independent, however, it follows that $\bm{x} = \bm{y} = \bm{z}$ and hence $x$
is an extreme point of $K$.

Conversely, assume that $\bm{x}$ is an extreme point of $K$. Let us assume that
the nonzero components of $\bm{x}$ are the first $k$ components. Then

$$ x_1\bm{a}_1 + x_2\bm{a}_2 + \cdots + x_k\bm{a}_k = \bm{b}, \quad x_i > 0,
\quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, k. $$

To show that $\bm{x}$ is a bsic feasible solution (BFS) it must be shown that
the vectors $\bm{a}_1, \bm{a}_2, \ldots, \bm{a}_k$ are linearly independent. We
do this by contradiction. Suppose they are linearly dependent. Then there is a
nontrivial linear combination that is zero: 

$$ y_1\bm{a}_1 + y_2\bm{a}_2 + \cdots y_k\bm{a}_k = \bm{0}. $$

Define the $n$-vector $\bm{y} = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_k, 0, 0, \ldots, 0)$. Since
$x_i > 0$, $1 \leq i \leq k$, it is possible to select $\varepsilon$ such that 

$$ \bm{x} + \varepsilon \bm{y} \geq \bm{0}, \quad \bm{x} - \varepsilon \bm{y}
\geq \bm{0}. $$


We then have $\bm{x} = \frac{1}{2}(\bm{x}+\varepsilon\bm{y}) +
\frac{1}{2}(\bm{x}-\varepsilon\bm{y})$ which expresses $\bm{x}$ as a convex
combination of two distinct vectors in $K$. <img src="contents/assets/66x71.png"
