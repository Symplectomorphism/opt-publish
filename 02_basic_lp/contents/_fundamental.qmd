a feasible solution to the constraints that achieves the minimum value of the
objective function subject to those constraints is said to be an _optimal
feasible solution_. If this solution is basic, it is an _optimal basic feasible
solution_.

## Fundamental Theorem
Given a linear program in standard form @eq-lp where $\bm{A}$ is an $m \times
n$ matrix of rank $m$,

1. if there is a feasible solution, there is a basic feasible solution;
2. if there is an optimal feasible solution, there is an optimal basic feasible
solution.
