* Suppose that for the LP in the standard primal form
$$
\begin{align}
\operatorname{minimize} & \bm{c}^\top \bm{x} \\
\text{subject to} & \bm{Ax} = \bm{b}, \quad \bm{x} \geq \bm{0},
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-primal}
we have the optimal basic feasible solution $\bm{x} = (\bm{x}_B, \bm{0})$ with
the corresponding basis $\bm{B}$.

&nbsp;

* Partition $\bm{A} = \begin{bmatrix} \bm{B} & \bm{D} \end{bmatrix}$, where the
primal basic feasible solution $\bm{x}_{\bm{B}} = \bm{B}^{-1}\bm{b}$ is optimal.

* We shall determine a solution of the dual program

$$
\begin{align}
\operatorname{maximize} & \bm{y}^\top \bm{b} \\
\text{subject to} & \bm{y}^\top\bm{A} \leq \bm{c}^\top,
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-dual}
in terms of $\bm{B}$.

* Define $\bm{y}^\top = \bm{c}_{\bm{B}}^\top \bm{B}^{-1}$, which is a dual basic
solution (The components of $\bm{c}_{\bm{B}}$ are those of $\bm{c}$ assoc. w/
the columns of the submatrix $\bm{B}$ according to the same index order.).
:::

* If, in addition, $\bm{y}^\top\bm{A} \leq \bm{c}^\top$, then $\bm{y}$ is
feasible and a basic feasible solution for the dual &mdash; an extreme point of
the dual feasible region. On the other hand

$$
\bm{y}^\top\bm{b} = \bm{c}_{\bm{B}}^\top \bm{B}^{-1}\bm{b} =
\bm{c}_{\bm{B}}^\top\bm{x}_{\bm{B}},
$$

and thus the value of the dual objective function for the $\bm{y}$ is equal to
the value of the primal problem. Hence $\bm{y}$ is optimal for the dual!

## Theorem
Let the linear program @eq-primal have an optimal basic feasible solution
corresponding to the basis $\bm{B}$. Then the vector $\bm{y}$ satisfying
$\bm{y}^\top = \bm{c}_{\bm{B}}^\top \bm{B}^{-1}$ is an optimal soluion to the
dual program @eq-dual if it is dual feasible. The optimal values of both
problems are equal.

* Columns of $\bm{A}$ and $\bm{b}$ are represented in the requirement space.
* A basic solution represents construction of $\bm{b}$ with positive weights,
$x_j$'s, on two of the $\bm{a}_j$'s.
* Primal problem: find weights for the conic combination of $\bm{b}$ by these
columns such that the weighted sum (by $c_j$'s) of the weights is minimized.

* Each column $\bm{a}_j$ of the primal defines a constraint of the dual as a
half-space whose boundary is $\perp$ to that column vector and is located at a
point determined by $c_j$.
* Dual obj. is maximized at an extreme point of the dual feasible region. 
  - At this point exactly two dual constraints are active.
  - These active constraints also correspond to an optimal basis of the primal.
* The vector defining the dual objective is a conic combination of the active
constraint vectors: $\bm{b} = x_1\bm{a}_1 + x_2\bm{a}_2$, with $x_i$'s being the
optimal solution of the primal!

## Dual Multipliers &mdash; Shadow Prices {.smaller}

* $\bm{y}^\top = \bm{c}_{\bm{B}}^\top \bm{B}^{-1}$ is not a solution to the dual
unless $\bm{B}$ is an optimal basis for the primal.
  - The vector $\bm{y}$ may be used at every step to calculate the relative cost
    coefficients or reduced gradients (to be introduced later).
  - $\bm{y}^\top = \bm{c}_{\bm{B}}^\top \bm{B}^{-1}$ is called the vector of
    _simplex multipliers_ or _shadow prices_.
* The components of the $\bm{a}_j$'s and $\bm{b}$ tells us how to construct
these vectors from the $\bm{e}_i$'s.
* Given any basis $\bm{B}$, any other vector can be constructed (synthetically)
as a linear combination of these basis vectors.
  - If there is a unit cost $c_j$ associated with each basis vector $\bm{a}_j$,
    then the cost of a (synthetic) vector constructed from the basis can be
    calculated as the corresponding linear combination of the $c_j$'s associated
    with the basis.
  - In particular, the cost of $\bm{e}_i$, when constructed from the basis
    $\bm{B}$, is $y_i$.
  - Thus the $y_i$'s can be interpreted as synthetic prices of the unit vectors.


## Dual Multipliers &mdash; Shadow Prices {.smaller}

* Any vector can be expressed in terms of the basis $\bm{B}$ in two steps:
  1. express the unit vector $\bm{e}_i$ in terms of the basis,
  2. express the desired vector as a linear combination of the $\bm{e}_i$'s.
* The corresponding synthetic cost of a vector constructed from the basis
$\bm{B}$ can be correspondingly computed directly by:
  1. find the synthetic price of the $\bm{a}_i$'s.
  2. use these prices to evaluate the cost of the linear combination of
  $\bm{e}_i$'s.
* Thus, the simplex multipliers can be used to quickly evaluate the synthetic
cost of any vector that is expressed in terms of the unit vectors $\bm{e}_i$'s.
* The difference between the true cost of this vector and the synthetic cost is
the relative cost.
  - The process of calculating the synthetic cost of a vector w.r.t. a given
    basis by using the simplex multipliers is sometimes referred to as _pricing
    out_ the vector.

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
Optimality of the primal corresponds to the situation where every vector
$\bm{a}_1, \bm{a}_2, \ldots, \bm{a}_n$ is cheaper when constructed from the
basis than when purchased directly at its own price. Thus, we have 

$$ \bm{y}^\top \bm{a}_j \leq c_j \;\; \text{ for }  j = 1, 2 , \ldots, n \quad
\text{or} \quad \bm{y}^\top \bm{A} \leq \bm{c}^\top. $$
