## Weak Duality Lemma
If $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{y}$ are feasible for the primal-dual pair, then
$\bm{c}^\top\bm{x} \geq \bm{y}^\top\bm{b}$.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Proof
We have 
$$ \bm{y}^\top \bm{b} = \bm{y}^\top \bm{Ax} \leq \bm{c}^\top \bm{x}, $$
the last inequality being valid sincd $\bm{x} \geq \bm{0}$ and $\bm{y}^\top
\bm{A} \leq \bm{c}^\top$.

## Corollary
If $\bm{x}_0$ and $\bm{y}_0$ are feasible for the primal-dual pair and if
$\bm{c}^\top \bm{x}_0 = \bm{y}_0^\top \bm{b}$, then $\bm{x}_0$ and $\bm{y}_0$
are optimal for their respective problems.

## Duality Theorem of LP
If either of the primal-dual pair problems has a finite optimal solution, so
does the other, and the corresponding values of the objective functions are
equal. If either problem has an unbounded objective, the other problem has no
feasible solution.

## Proof
Firstly, the second statement is an immediate consequence of weak duality. If
the primal is unbounded and $\bm{y}$ is feasible for the dual, we must have
$\bm{y}^\top \bm{b} \leq -M$ for arbitrarily large $M$, which is clearly
impossible.

Let us assume that the primal has a finite optimal solution and show that the
dual has a solution with the same value (recall primal/dual are reversible). We
prove that if the primal problem is feasible and its minimal value is bounded
from below, then the system

$$
\begin{align}
&\bm{Ax} = \bm{b}, \quad \bm{x} \geq \bm{0}, \\
&\bm{A}^\top \bm{y} \leq \bm{c}, \\
&\bm{c}^\top \bm{x} - \bm{b}^\top \bm{y} \leq 0
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-sys}

has a feasible solution pair $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{y}$. The first system in @eq-sys
is the primal constraint system, the second is the dual constraint system, and
the third is the reversed duality gap, which, together with weak duality,
implies zero-duality gap $\bm{c}^\top \bm{x} - \bm{b}^\top \bm{y} = 0$.

## Proof - Continued - 
We first show that the dual must be feasible, since otherwise, from Farkas's
lemma the algernative system to the second system @eq-sys must be feasible, that
is, there is $\bm{x}^\prime \geq \bm{0}$ such that $(\bm{Ax^\prime} = \bm{0}, \;
\bm{c}^\top\bm{x}^\prime = -1)$. Let $\bm{x}$ be any given feasible solution for
the primal, then the solution $\bm{x} + \alpha \bm{x}^\prime$ must also be
feasible for the primal for any scalar $\alpha > 0$. But the primal objective
value at this solution is 
$$
\bm{c}^\top(x + \alpha \bm{x}^\prime) = \bm{c}^\top \bm{x} + \alpha \bm{c}^\top
\bm{x}^\prime = \bm{c}^\top \bm{x} - \alpha
$$
which is unbounded from below as $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$ leading to a
contradiction.

Now, both the primal and the dual are feasible but suppose their optimal values
are not equal; that is, the whole system @eq-sys remains infeasible. Then its
alternative system must be feasible. That is, there are $(\bm{y}^\prime,
\bm{x}^\prime, \tau)$ to satisfy the constraints
$$ \bm{Ax^\prime} - \bm{b}\tau = \bm{0}, \quad \bm{A}^\top \bm{y}^\prime -
\bm{c}\tau \leq \bm{0}, \quad \bm{b}^\top \bm{y}^\prime - \bm{c}^\top
\bm{x}^\prime = 1, \quad \bm{x}^\prime \geq 0, \quad \tau \geq 0. $$ {#eq-fs}

__<font style="font-variant: small-caps">Case 1</font>__: $\tau > 0$ in @eq-fs,
then we have
$$ 0 \geq (-\bm{y}^\prime)^\top (\bm{Ax^\prime} - \bm{b}\tau) +
(\bm{x}^\prime)^\top (\bm{A}^\top \bm{y}^\prime - \bm{c}\tau) =
\tau(\bm{b}^\top\bm{y}^\prime - \bm{c}^\top \bm{x}^\prime) = \tau $$
which is a _contradiction_.

__<font style="font-variant: small-caps">Case 2</font>__: $\tau = 0$ in @eq-fs,
then we let $\bm{x}$ be any feasible solution for the primal and $\bm{y}$ be any
feasible solution for the dual. Again $\bm{x} + \alpha \bm{x}^\prime$ must also
be feasible for the primal and $\bm{y} + \alpha \bm{y}^\prime$ must also be
feasible for the dual, and the objective gap at this pair is
$$ \bm{c}^\top(\bm{x} + \alpha \bm{x}^\prime) - \bm{b}^\top(\bm{y} + \alpha
\bm{y}^\prime) = \bm{c}^\top \bm{x} - \bm{b}^\top \bm{y} + \alpha(\bm{c}^\top
\bm{x}^\prime - \bm{b}^\top \bm{y}^\prime) = \bm{c}^\top \bm{x} - \bm{b}^\top
\bm{y} - \alpha $$
which is not bounded below by $0$ as $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$ and creates a
contradition to weak duality.
