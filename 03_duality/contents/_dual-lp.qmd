* If $\bm{A}$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, then $\bm{x}$ is an $n$-vector,
$\bm{b}$ is an $m$-vector, $\bm{c}$ is an $n$ vector, and $\bm{y}$ is an
$m$-vector.

* The vector $\bm{x}$ is the variable of the primal program, and $\bm{y}$ is the
variable of the dual program.

The roles of the primal and the dual can be reversed!

* Interchange cost and constraint vectors,
* Change minimization to maximization.

Multiplying the objective and the constraints by minus unity, the dual has the
structure of the primal.

Its corresponding dual will be equivalent to the original primal.

## Conversion to dual

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Partition the dual vector as $(\bm{u}, \bm{v})$, we get

$$
\begin{align}
\operatorname{maximize} & \bm{u}^\top\bm{b} - \bm{v}^\top\bm{b}, \\
\text{subject to} & \bm{u}^\top\bm{A} - \bm{v}^\top\bm{A} \leq \bm{c}^\top, \\
& \bm{u}, \bm{v} \geq \bm{0} 
\end{align}
$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Letting $\bm{y} = \bm{u} - \bm{v}$, this is simplified as

$$
\begin{align}
\operatorname{minimize} & \bm{y}^\top \bm{b},  \\
\text{subject to} & \bm{y}^\top\bm{A} \leq \bm{c}^\top.
\end{align}
$$

* This is the _asymmetric form_ of the duality relation. In this form the dual
vector $\bm{y}$ is *not* restricted to be nonnegative.


## General Procedure for Conversion {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
The _dual of the dual is the primal_!
:::

1. The objective coefficient vector of the primal becomes the right-hand-side
vector of the dual constraints,
2. The right-hand-side vector of the primal constraints becomes the objective
coefficient vector of the dual,
3. The transpose of the constraint matrix of the primal becomes the constraint
matrix of the dual,
4. Every primal variable corresponds to a constraint in the dual, and its sign
decides the sense of the dual constraint,
5. Every primal constraint corresponds to a variable in the dual, and its sense
decides the sign of the dual variable.

Dual can be viewed as the acquisition pricing problem: a buyer sets the prices
for the three resources of the producer:

1. each of the constraints indicates that the prices are competitive or even
better than producing each product by the producer itself,
2. the objective is to minimize the total acuisition cost.

## Dual Interpretation
Imagine a pharmaceutical company that produces in pill form each of the
nutrients considered important by the dietitian. The company tries to convince
the dietitian to buy pills, and thereby supply the nutrients directly rather
than through purchase of various foods.

1. The company must decide the positive unit prices: $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m$ for
the nutrients so as to maximize revenue while at the same time being competitive
with real food.

2. The cost of a unit food $i$ made synthetically from pure nutrients bought
from the druggist must be no greater than $c_i$, the market price of the food.

3. Thus, denoting by $\bm{a}_i$ the $i^{\text{th}}$ food, the company must
satisfy $\bm{y}^\top \bm{a}_i \leq \bm{c}_i$ for each $i$.

4. Since $b_j$ units of the $j^{\text{th}}$ nutrient will be purchased, the
problem of the druggist is on the right.

## Interpretation
Imagine that the company, responsible for shipping the product quantities from
the origins to the destinations, plans to launch a new and simplified "pricing"
scheme to the manufacturer:

1. charge ${\$}u_i$ for every unit shipped out from origin site $i$; and $\$v_j$
for every unit shipped to the destination site $j$.
2. The shipping company would select unit prices/costs $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m$
for the $m$ origins and $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ for the $n$ destinations such
that $u_i + v_j \leq c_{ij}$ for all $i, j$.

This is to convince the manufacturer customer to accept the new scheme since
$u_i+ v_j$ represents the net amount the manufacturer must pay to ship a unit of
product from origin $i$ to destination $j$.

## Example 4 &ndash; Dual of the MDP Problem {.smaller}

\begin{align}

\in \mathcal{A}_i, \\
& & \forall i = 1, \ldots, m.
\end{align}
$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
The dual problem would be

$$
\begin{align}
\operatorname{minimize} & \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}_j} c_j x_j \\
\text{subject to} & \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}_i} (\bm{e}_i - \gamma
\bm{p}_j)x_j = \bm{1}, \\
& x_j \geq 0, \;\; \forall j \in \mathcal{A}_i, \;\; \forall i = 1, \ldots, m,
\end{align}
$$

where $\bm{e}_i$ is the unit vector with $1$ for the $i^{\text{th}}$ entry and
$0$ everywhere else.

Variable $x_j$, $j \in \mathcal{A}_i$ represents the expected total discounted
present frequency, or the total expected present number of times taking action
$j$ in a state $i$, during the process.
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Since $c_j$ is the immediate cost of taking action $j$ once, $c_jx_j$ represents
the total expected present cost of taking action $j$ during the process so that
the objective of the dual represents the overall expected present cost of the
entire process.
:::

:::

::::

* When the objective of the dual is minimized, only one flux/frequency in each
state would be positive, which establishes an optimal policy.
