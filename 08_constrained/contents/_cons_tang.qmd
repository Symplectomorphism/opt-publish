* An inequality constraint is said to be _active_ at $\bm{x}$ if $g_i(\bm{x}) =
0$.
* It is said to be _inactive_ if $g_i(\bm{x}) > 0$.
* Any equality constraint $h_i(\bm{x}) = 0$ is _active_.
* In the figure, $g_1$ is active, $g_2$ and $g_3$ are not.
* If it were known a priori which constraints were active at an optimal solution
then it would be a local minimum point of the problem defined by ignoring the
inactive constraints.

* $\bm{h} = (h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_m)$, $\;\;\bm{g} = (g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_p)$ are
_functional constraints_.
* $\bm{x} \in \Omega$: set constraint.

* We will therefore start by ignoring the inequality constraints and come back
to them later.


## Tangent Plane {.smaller}

* The equality constraints define a (hyper)surface $S = \{\bm{x}: h_1(\bm{x}) =
h_2(\bm{x}) = \cdots = h_m(\bm{x}) = 0\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  - This hypersurface is of dimension $n-m$ (subject to a regularity assumption).
  - If the functions $h_i$ are continuously differentiable, the surface is said
    to be _smooth_.
* Associated with a point on a smooth surface is the _tangent plane_ at that
point.
  - A _curve_ on a surface $S$ is a familty of points $\bm{x}(t) \in S$, $a \leq
    t \leq b$.
  - The curve is _differentiable_ if $\dot{\bm{x}}(t) = \frac{d}{d
    t}\bm{x}(t)$ exists, and is _twice differentiable_ if $\ddot{\bm{x}}(t)$
    exists.
  - A curve $\bm{x}(t)$ is said to pass through the point $\bm{x}^\ast$ if
    $\bm{x}^\ast = \bm{x}(t^\ast)$ for some $a \leq t^\ast \leq b$.

## Tangent Plane
Consider all differentiable curves on $S$ passing through a point $\bm{x}^\ast$.
The _tangent plane_ $T_{x^\ast}S$ at $\bm{x}^\ast$ of $S$ is defined as the
collection of hte derivatives at $\bm{x}^\ast$ of all these differentiable
curves.

If $\bm{x}^\ast$ is a _regular point_ (to be defined) then we can make the
following identification:

$$ T_{\bm{x}^\ast}S = M \triangleq \{\bm{d}: \nabla \bm{h}(\bm{x}^\ast)\bm{d} =
\bm{0} \}. $$

## Definition (Regular Point)
A point $\bm{x}^\ast$ satisfying the constraint $\bm{h}(\bm{x}^\ast) = \bm{0}$
is said to be a _regular point_ of the constraint if the gradient vectors
$\nabla h_1(\bm{x}^\ast), \nabla h_2(\bm{x}^\ast), \ldots, \nabla
h_m(\bm{x}^\ast)$ are linearly independent.
