# Constraints and the Tangent Plane

## Constraints {.smaller}

General nonlinear programming problems are of the form

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

$$
\begin{align}
\operatorname{minimize} & f(\bm{x}) \\
\text{subject to} & \bm{h}(\bm{x}) = \bm{0}, \;\; \bm{g}(\bm{x}) \geq \bm{0}, \\ 
& \bm{x} \in \Omega.
\end{align}
$$

* An inequality constraint is said to be _active_ at $\bm{x}$ if $g_i(\bm{x}) =
0$.
* It is said to be _inactive_ if $g_i(\bm{x}) > 0$.
* Any equality constraint $h_i(\bm{x}) = 0$ is _active_.
* In the figure, $g_1$ is active, $g_2$ and $g_3$ are not.
* If it were known a priori which constraints were active at an optimal solution
then it would be a local minimum point of the problem defined by ignoring the
inactive constraints.

* $\bm{h} = (h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_m)$, $\;\;\bm{g} = (g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_p)$ are
_functional constraints_.
* $\bm{x} \in \Omega$: set constraint.

* We will therefore start by ignoring the inequality constraints and come back
to them later.
