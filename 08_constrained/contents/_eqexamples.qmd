# Equality Constrained Optimization Examples

## Example 1 &ndash; Geometric Prog.: Max Volume {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
We seek to construct a cardboard box of maximum volume, given a fixed area of
the cardboard.

\begin{align}

## First-Order Necessary Conditions
$$
\begin{align}
yz - \lambda (y+z) &= 0, \\
xz - \lambda (x+z) &= 0, \\
xy - \lambda (x+y) &= 0.
\end{align}
$$

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
Since no variables can be zero, we have 
$$x = y = z = \sqrt{\frac{c}{6}} \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda =
\frac{\sqrt{6c}}{12}. $$

::: {.column width="50%"}
* Summing the FONC gives $(xy + yz + xz) - 2\lambda(x+y+z) = 0$.
* Using the constraint with this implies
$$ \frac{c}{2} - 2\lambda(x+y+z) = 0. $$
  - From this it is clear that $\lambda \neq 0$.
* Next, we see that none of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are zero.
  - This is because if, say, $x=0$, then $z$ becomes zero (second eq.), which
    implies $y=0$ from the first equation.
* Multiply the first by $x$, second by $y$ and subtract to obtain 
$$ \lambda(x-y)z = 0. $$
* Similarly operate on second and third to obtain $\lambda (y-z)x = 0$.
