# Equality Constrained Optimization Examples

## Example 1 &ndash; Geometric Prog.: Max Volume {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
We seek to construct a cardboard box of maximum volume, given a fixed area of
the cardboard.

\begin{align}

## First-Order Necessary Conditions
$$
\begin{align}
yz - \lambda (y+z) &= 0, \\
xz - \lambda (x+z) &= 0, \\
xy - \lambda (x+y) &= 0.
\end{align}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
Since no variables can be zero, we have 
$$x = y = z = \sqrt{\frac{c}{6}} \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda =
\frac{\sqrt{6c}}{12}. $$

::: {.column width="50%"}
* Summing the FONC gives $(xy + yz + xz) - 2\lambda(x+y+z) = 0$.
* Using the constraint with this implies
$$ \frac{c}{2} - 2\lambda(x+y+z) = 0. $$
  - From this it is clear that $\lambda \neq 0$.
* Next, we see that none of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are zero.
  - This is because if, say, $x=0$, then $z$ becomes zero (second eq.), which
    implies $y=0$ from the first equation.
* Multiply the first by $x$, second by $y$ and subtract to obtain 
$$ \lambda(x-y)z = 0. $$
* Similarly operate on second and third to obtain $\lambda (y-z)x = 0$.

## Example 2 &ndash; Hanging Chain {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
A chain is suspended from two thin hooks that are $16$ ft. apart on a horizontal
line. Each link is one foot in length (measured inside). We wish to formulate
the problem to determine the equilibrium shape of the chain.

The solution can be found by minimizing the potential energy of the chain.

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
* Let link $i$ span an $x$ distance of $x_i$ and a $y$ distance of $y_i$.
* Then $x_i^2 + y_i^2 = 1$.
* The potential energy of a link is its weight times its height.
* The total potential energy of the chain is the sum of those of each link.

* With the top of the chain as reference and assuming the mass of each link is
concentrated at its center

$$
\begin{align}
P &= \frac{y_1}{2} + (y_1 + \frac{y_2}{2}) + (y_1 + y_2 + \frac{y_3}{2}) +
\cdots \\
&+ \, (y_1 + y_2 + \cdots + y_{n-1} + \frac{y_n}{2}) = \sum_{i=1}^n
(n-i+\frac{1}{2})y_i.
\end{align}
$$

where $n = 20$ in our example.
