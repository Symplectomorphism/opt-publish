    "text": "What is mathematical optimization?\nWe have a complex decision problem to solve.\n\nRunning a business: maximize profit, minimize loss, maximize efficiency, or minimize risk.\nDesign: minimize the weight of a bridge/truss and maximize the strength within the design constraints.\nPlanning: select a flight route to minimize time or fuel consumption of an airplane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy\n\n\nApproach the problem, involving the selection of values for a number of interrelated variables, by focusing attention on a single objective designed to quantify performance and measure the quality of the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nThis one objective is maximized subject to the constraints that may limit the selection of decision variable values."
