* Linear programming (LP) is the most natural mechanism for formulating a vast 
array of problems with modest effort.

* LPs are characterized by linear functions of the unknowns:
  - objective is linear in the unknowns,
  - constraints are linear (in)equalities in the unknowns.

* LP formulations are popular because
  - mathematics is nicer,
  - the theory is richer,
  - the computation is simpler.

* Consider a budget problem:
  - Total amount of money is to be allocated among two different commodities:
  $$ 
  x_1 + x_2 \leq B
  $$
  - Objective is to maximize the weight:
  $$
  w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2
  $$
  where $w_j, \, j=1,2$ is the unit weight of commodity $j$.

- $18^{th}$ century Europe was fascinated by automata such as Vaucanson's 
duck, which was complex by the standards of the day.

- Jacquard extended these ideas and developed a loom, which was essentially a 
programmable weaving machine.

## Good-old days

- The term __robot__ was first introduced by the Czech playwright Karel 
&Ccaron;apek in his $1920$ play Rossum's Universal Robots.
- The word __robota__ is the Czech word for worker.

- The first patent for what we would now consider a robot was filed in $1954$ 
by George C. Devol.

- The device comprised a mechanical arm with a gripper that was mounted on a 
track.
