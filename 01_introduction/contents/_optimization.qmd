# Optimization

## What is mathematical optimization? {.smaller}

We have a complex decision problem to solve.

* Running a business: maximize profit, minimize loss, maximize efficiency, or minimize risk.
* Design: minimize the weight of a bridge/truss and maximize the strength within the design constraints.
* Planning: select a flight route to minimize time or fuel consumption of an airplane.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Philosophy
Approach the problem, involving the selection of values for a number of interrelated _variables_, 
by focusing attention on a single _objective_ designed to quantify performance and measure the 
quality of the decision.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
This one objective is _maximized_ subject to the _constraints_ that may limit the selection of
decision variable values.

## Problem formulation {.smaller}

&nbsp;

* Always involves a tradeoff between conflicting objectives:
  - building a mathematical model suffiently complex to accurately capture the problem description,
  - building a model that is __tractable__.

* The expert model builder is facile with both aspects of this tradeoff.
* One aspiring to become such an expert must learn to identify and capture the 
important issues of a problem mainly through example and experience.
* One must learn to distinguish tractable models from nontractable ones
  - study of available theory
  - nurturing the capability to extend existing theory to new situations.

## Manufacturing robots

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

<br>

- Typically operate in factories and are the technological descendents of the
first generation robots.

- Arm-type manipulators on a fixed base that performs repetitive tasks within a
  local work cell.

## Service robots

:::: {.columns}

<br><br>

::: {.column width="50%"}
- They supply services to people such as cleaning, personal care, medical
rehabilitation or fetching and carrying.

- Must operate and move in a complex, cluttered, and changing environment.

## Field robots {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- They work outdoors on tasks such as environmental monitoring, agriculture,
mining, construction and forestry.

<br>

- Must operate and move in a complex, cluttered, and changing environment.
  - Mars rover must navigate rocks, small craters despite not having an accurate
    local map.
  - Self-driving cars must follow roads, avoid obstacles and obey traffic
    signals, and the rules of the road.

## Humanoid robots

::: {.column width="50%"}
They have the physical form of a human being -- they are both mobile robots and
service robots.

## So, what is a robot?

## Our definition of robot
A robot is a goal-oriented machine that can sense, plan and act.
::: 
:::: 

:::: {.columns .fragment .fade-up}

::: {.column width="50%"}
A robot senses its environment and uses that information, together with a goal,
to *plan* some action.
